# DSA-Chess

Welcome to the DSA-Chess project! This is my first Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project, where I have implemented a chess game using various data structures to enhance the gameplay experience.

## Features

- **Two-player mode**: Play against another player.
- **Move validation**: Ensures that all moves are legal according to chess rules.
- **Board representation**: Utilizes a 2D array to represent the chessboard.
- **Piece movement**: Implements movement logic for all chess pieces.
- **Game state management**: Keeps track of the game state, including check and checkmate conditions.

### Backtracking algorithm
Backtracking is a powerful algorithmic technique for solving problems incrementally, by trying partial solutions and then abandoning them if they are not valid. In the context of chess, backtracking can be used for various purposes, such as:

Finding all possible moves: When a player makes a move, backtracking can help explore all potential subsequent moves for both players.
Solving chess puzzles: Backtracking can be employed to find solutions to chess puzzles, such as checkmate in a certain number of moves.
Game tree exploration: Backtracking can be used to traverse the game tree, evaluating different sequences of moves to determine the best strategy.
Example of Backtracking in Chess
In a chess game, if a player wants to explore all possible moves from a given position, backtracking can be used to:

Generate all possible legal moves for the current player.
For each move, make the move and recursively explore the next player's possible moves.
If a move leads to a winning position, it can be recorded; otherwise, the move is undone (backtracked) to explore other options.
